    ///   Taken from https://github.com/OskarSigvardsson/unity-quickhull
    /// 
    ///   An implementation of the quickhull algorithm for generating 3d convex
    ///   hulls.
    ///
    ///   The algorithm works like this: you start with an initial "seed" hull,
    ///   that is just a simple tetrahedron made up of four points in the point
    ///   cloud. This seed hull is then grown until it all the points in the
    ///   point cloud is inside of it, at which point it will be the convex hull
    ///   for the entire set.
    ///
    ///   All of the points in the point cloud is divided into two parts, the
    ///   "open set" and the "closed set". The open set consists of all the
    ///   points outside of the tetrahedron, and the closed set is all of the
    ///   points inside the tetrahedron. After each iteration of the algorithm,
    ///   the closed set gets bigger and the open set get smaller. When the open
    ///   set is empty, the algorithm is finished.
    ///
    ///   Each point in the open set is assigned to a face that it lies outside
    ///   of. To grow the hull, the point in the open set which is farthest from
    ///   it's face is chosen. All faces which are facing that point (I call
    ///   them "lit faces" in the code, because if you imagine the point as a
    ///   point light, it's the set of points which would be lit by that point
    ///   light) are removed, and a "horizon" of edges is found from where the
    ///   faces were removed. From this horizon, new faces are constructed in a
    ///   "cone" like fashion connecting the point to the edges.
    ///
    ///   To keep track of the faces, I use a struct for each face which
    ///   contains the three vertices of the face in CCW order, as well as the
    ///   three triangles which share an edge. I was considering doing a
    ///   half-edge structure to store the mesh, but it's not needed. Using a
    ///   struct for each face and neighbors simplify the algorithm and makes it
    ///   easy to export it as a mesh.
    ///
    ///   The most subtle part of the algorithm is finding the horizon. In order
    ///   to properly construct the cone so that all neighbors are kept
    ///   consistent, you can do a depth-first search from the first lit face.
    ///   If the depth-first search always proceeeds in a counter-clockwise
    ///   fashion, it guarantees that the horizon will be found in a
    ///   counter-clockwise order, which makes it easy to construct the cone of
    ///   new faces.
    ///
    ///   A note: the code uses a right-handed coordinate system, where the
    ///   cross-product uses the right-hand rule and the faces are in CCW order.
    ///   At the end of the algorithm, the hull is exported in a Unity-friendly
    ///   fashion, with a left-handed mesh.
